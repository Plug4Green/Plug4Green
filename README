FIT4GREEN PLUG-IN


Description:

FIT4Green plug-in is an application that focuses on saving energy in Data Centres optimizing the ICT resources 
and is meant to be used by Data Centres operators.
This README explains the requisites and configuration to compile FIT4Green plug-in source code.


Preliminary configuration:

The following components/tools needs configuration before starting to develop on the F4G projects:
*	The Java environment (at different levels : Tomcat, Eclipse, Ant Eclipse plugin).
*	The Tomcat server 

Java Environment settings:
The JDK for java 1.6 includes natively a version of jaxb, but if is obsolete with respect to the latest version 
of JAXB (v2.2.1), which is contained in the lib folder of the "Schemas" project.
Therefore, for compatibility issues, it is required to put the jaxb-api.jar (contained in the lib folder of the 
"Schemas" project) 
in the "endorsed libs" folder of the jre used (both for the compilation in Eclipse and for the execution in Tomcat).
To sum up:
*	Detect the “JAVA_HOME” path for your environment
*	Create (if not existing) the folder [“JAVA_HOME]/jre/lib/endorsed
*	Copy there the file “jaxb-api.jar” contained in the lib folder of the "schemas" project

Then, you must make sure that the Eclipse “Java Build path”configuration for each project is properly set to point 
to that Java environment. By expanding the “JRE System Library” item you can verify that the “jaxb-api.jar” in the 
endorsed lib is used by the Java environment.  
 
Finally, you need to specify the same setting in the Ant Eclipse plugin used to build and deploy the projects.
Right click on the “build.xml” file in the root of each project and select “Run As|External tools configurations…”.

Select the “JRE” tab, and verify that it is using the expected Java environment containing the 
“endorsed/jaxb-api.jar” lib.

 
Tomcat:
The jar resulting from the build of each F4G project will be deployed on the Tomcat server and will be accessed and 
shared by one or more web applications. This requires that they are deployed in a specific folder as described 
in the following.
1.	If they do not exist, create the folders:
*	[TOMCAT_HOME]/common/lib
*	[TOMCAT_HOME]/common/classes (currently not used, might be needed in the future)

2.	Configure the “catalina.properties” file as follows:
*	Open the file [TOMCAT_HOME]/conf/catalina.properties
*	Append  the following string to the  “common.loader” property:
“,${catalina.home}/common/classes,${catalina.home}/common/lib/*.jar”

Ant build.xml files:
Inside the project Plugin_core contains "build-all.xml" that builds all the projects within FIT4Green plug-in.
All the projects (except the “Ajax GUI Test”) contain a "build.xml" file in the project root, with some pre-configured targets 
to clean, compile, package and deploy the project. 
The “Schemas” project, in addition, contains a “generate” target to create java files from schema files. 
The “InitServlet”  contains a target to package the web application into a war file.
When the “Ant” task is executed on a “build.xml” file, it retrieves some global configuration data from the 
“Commons/build.properties” file, contained in the root of the “Commons” project.
The only element in the “build.properties” file that is dependent on the local configuration, is the entry: 
"tomcat.home=[to be set to your tomcat home]"
This entry is used by the ant target "deploy" to put the generated jars in the "${TOMCAT_HOME}/common/lib" of the Tomcat server.
Rename "local.build.properties.template" to "local.build.properties" and configure this property in the "local.build.properties" 
file in the “Commons” project.

Eclipse:
Configure your Runtime Environment located at windows -> preferences to your Tomcat installation.
Ensure that every project is compiled with at least 1.6 Java version.	

External libraries requierement:
- F4Gui
  This project needs GWT installed and you need to add the references to your installed GWT.

Compile:
Use the build-all.xml provided with the project Plugin_core. This will compile all the projects and will deploy the corresponding 
files inside the correct folders.
F4gGui has to be compiled with GWT. 
Install GWT plug-in for eclipse and compile the project using run as... compile GWT Application with the F4gGui project.

Usage:
If Configured FIT4Green to start automatically then simply start your Tomcat and FIT4Green plug-in will start automatically.
Open the web application F4gGui with: http://localhost:8080/F4gGui click the start button to start the plug-in.
Use this web application to manage the FIT4Green plug-in.
