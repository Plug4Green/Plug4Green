		<h1>How do I configure the network of the host machine?</h1>
		
		<h2>Using Bridged Adapter</h2>
		
		<p>From the main window of VirtualBox, right click on the VM you want to
		configure (the VM must be off) and select <b>Settings</b></p>
		
		<img src="../img/help-01.jpg">
		
		<p>In the left panel of the Settings window select <b>Network</b></p>
		
		<p>In the <b>Adapter1</b> tab check the <b>Enable Network Adapter</b> 
		check-box</p>
		
		<p>From the <b>Attached to:</b> combo select <b>Bridged Adapter</b></p>
		
		<p>From the <b>Name</b> combo, select the name of the network connection 
		you are going to use.</p>
		
		<img src="../img/help-02.jpg">
		
		<p>Please note that you can use either the Ethernet connection or the wireless 
		connection.	This setting can be modified also after the creation of the VM, 
		even while the VM is on.</p>
		
		<p>In this latter case, you have to:</p>
		
		<p>Right click on the networking icon on the bottom right side of the window 
		displaying the VM, and click on <b>Network Adapters</b></p>
		
		<img src="../img/help-03.jpg">
			
		<p>Select the other network adapter from the <b>Name</b> combo box and click 
		OK</p>
		
		<img src="../img/help-04.jpg">
		
		<p>After some seconds the OS will detect the change in the network 
		adapter and it will get another IP address.</p>
