		<h2><a name="Q1"></a>How do I launch the FIT4Green plug-in in DEMO mode?</h2>
		
		<p>You can take a first taste of how the plug-in operates by launching it in
		DEMO mode. To do so, simply follow the steps below:

		<ol>
			<li>Open the FIT4Green Management UI on your browser:
			<pre>http://localhost:8080/F4gGui/</pre>
			
			<li>Start the plug-in by pressing "Start"
		</ol>
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>

		<h2><a name="Q2"></a>How do I install the FIT4Green plug-in?</h2>
		
		<p>You can follow the simple steps below:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Install the contents of this CD on a new (virtual) machine. Please see
			<a href="../help/NetworkConfiguration.html">here</a> for details on how to
			configure the network of the host machine.
			
			<li>Boot the new (virtual) machine and perform the next steps from 
			within it
		
			<li>Stop the Tomcat server; on a terminal you can run:
			<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/tomcat6/bin/shutdown.sh</pre>

			<li>Edit the FIT4Green configuration files; for details see:
			<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/tomcat6/common/classes/config/*.properties</pre>

			<li>Start the Tomcat server; on a terminal you can run:
			<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/tomcat6/bin/startup.sh</pre>

			<li>Open the FIT4Green Management UI on your browser:
			<pre>http://localhost:8080/F4gGui/</pre>

			<li>If applicable, start the plug-in by pressing "Start"
		</ol>

		<h2><a name="Q3"></a>How do I use the built-in development environment?</h2>

		<P>You can launch eclipse:
		<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/eclipse</pre>
		The workspace includes the source code of the main components of the plug-in.
		It is in effect the snapshot of the development environment that was used 
		to built this live CD.</p>
		
		<p>Please note that changes cannot be committed to the code repository, 
		since it is just an export and not a checkout.</p>

		<h2><a name="Q4"></a>Where can I find the FIT4Green log files?</h2>

		<p>The default location for the FIT4Green log file is:
		<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green.log</pre>
		You can change the location of this file along with other logging possibilities by
		updating the file:
		<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/tomcat6/common/classes/config/log4j.properties</pre>
		</p>

		<h2><a name="Q5"></a>When opening the configuration files on the Configuration tab, I get a message
		if I want to save changes even though I made none. What is this all about?</h2>

		<p>This is caused by the browser on Linux altering the line-end characters from 
		the files which are most likely created on Windows. It can be solved by opening 
		and saving each of the files once from within Linux.

		<h2><a name="Q6"></a>How do I take a look at the databases where historical data are stored?</h2>

		<p>The plug-in manages programmatically the couchDB databases; so there is no need to perform
		any administration tasks per se. Nevertheless, in case you wish to browse through the databases,
		CouchDB comes with a built-in interface called Futon. To load Futon in your browser, visit:
		<pre>http://localhost:5984/_utils/index.html</pre>

		<h2><a name="Q7">How do I configure the plug-in for use with one of the already developed
		communication modules?</a></h2>

		<p> The FIT4Green live CD includes the necessary libraries for running the plug-in at the three 
		FIT4Green pilot	sites: a service/enterprise portal at Eni S.p.A. (Italy), supercomputing grid at 
		Juelich Supercomputing Centre (Germany) and cloud computing data centres at HP Italy Innovation 
		Centre (Italy).
		</p>
		
		<p> You can configure the plug-in for use with one of the already developed communication modules by 
		editing the FIT4Green configuration file:
		<pre>/home/fit4green/Fit4Green/tomcat6/common/classes/config/f4gconfig.properties</pre>
		</p>
		
		<p> For more information on the communication module related to the service/enterprise portal at Eni, 
		see <a href="../help/ConfigurationENI.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p> For more information on the communication module related to the supercomputing grid at Juelich, 
		see <a href="../help/ConfigurationJuelich.html">here</a>.
