		<p>The FIT4Green UI is a web based interface to manage the FIT4Green plug-in. The interface provides 
		three main pages: 
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>Status</b> page contains buttons to <i>Start</i> and <i>Stop</i> the plug-in.
			The <i>Optimize</i> button can be used to request a global optimization; the adjacent radio
			button provides the option of selecting the optimization objective: either based on power 
			consumption or CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It also shows the current state (stopped or running).
			
			<p>Two buttons provide the data centre operator with the ability to approve, <i>OK</i>, or 
			cancel, <i>Cancel</i> the latest set of actions suggested by the plug-in. These buttons are 
			enabled only under semi-automatic operational mode.	The operational mode is set at configuration 
			time from within the <font face="Courier New">f4gconfig.properties</font> file. The actions to be 
			approved are shown within the table <i>Actions suggested</i>. In case the actions are not 
			approved within 3 minutes, they are automatically cancelled.
			
			<p>The table where the latest set of actions is displayed includes a column where the 
			parameters of the actions are detailed, <i>Parameter(s)</i>. The actions are presented with 
			gray colour unless they are pending for approval.
			
			<p>Under <i>Framework status</i> error messages are displayed. These messages involve the 
			status of a Com component communicating with a data centre framework
			
			<p>
						
			<li>The <b>Configuration</b> page lists all configuration files, such as models, SLAs and other 
			constraints and policies, and plug-in and Com properties files. The files can be viewed, 
			edited, created, and deleted. The configuration files can be edited with the XML 
			editor, while the properties files are simple text files.
			
			<p>
			
			<li>The <b>Statistics</b> page provides information (via visualizations) on both current and 
			past power consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, actions suggested and site(s) topology.
			
			<p> The graph provides the option to select the granularity level of visualizing past and current 
			power consumption or CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; one can select among site, data centre, or both.
			
			<p> The timeline aggregates similar actions suggested and forwarded by the plug-in at a given 
			point in time. Hovering the mouse over the action box, a pop-up test informs you on how many 
			actions were actually forwarded.
			
			<p> By moving the blue line within the timeline (selected from under the time axis), one can 
			select a given point in time and then press the topology icon; a window is then displayed where 
			the topology of the model instance at the selected timestamp is shown. The greyed out elements 
			indicate resources that are powered off.
		</ul>
		
		<p> It should be noted that the communication with the core FIT4Green components 
		on server side is asynchronous. This means that, generally, minor delays can be 
		experienced.

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
		<h4><a href="#Q1">On the <b>Status</b> page I see that the plug-in, from time to time, 
		suggests actions, for example <i>Power On</i> and <i>Power off</i>. How can I know if they are 
		applied?</a></h4>
		
		<h4><a href="#Q2">Can I manually trigger the plug-in for a global optimization?</a></h4>
		
		<h4><a href="#Q3">Can I update the configuration files on the fly?</a></h4>
		
		<h4><a href="#Q4">It seems that the plug-in is sometimes slow in responding to my requests. Is this
		normal?</a></h4>
		
		<p>
		<p>

		<h3><a name="Q1"></a>On the <b>Status</b> page I see that the plug-in, from time to time, 
		suggests actions, for example <i>Power On</i> and <i>Power off</i>. How can I know if they are 
		applied?</h3>
		
		<p>You can go to the <b>Statistics</b> page and verify in the Actions timeline if such 
		actions have been applied. You can then have a look at the graph above to see if and how the 
		applied actions affected the system.

		<p>
		
		<h3><a name="Q2"></a>Can I manually trigger the plug-in for a global optimization?</h3>
		
		<p>Yes, you can trigger a global optimization at any time and while the plug-in is running. On 
		the <b>Status</b> you simply press the <i>Optimize</i> option. Your request will then be propagated 
		to the plug-in. The suggested actions, if any, are displayed within the table under <i>Actions 
		suggested</i>

		<p>
		
		<h3><a name="Q3"></a>Can I update the configuration files on the fly?</h3>
		
		<p>No, for the updates within the configuration files to take effect you must stop the plug-in and
		then re-start.

		<h3><a name="Q4"></a>It seems that the plug-in is sometimes slow in responding to my requests. Is this
		normal?</h3>
		
		<p>Yes; the communication with the core FIT4Green components on server side is asynchronous. 
		This means that, generally, minor delays can be experienced.
