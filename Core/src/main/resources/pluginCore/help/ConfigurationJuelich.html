		<h2><a name="Q1"></a>What is the general approach to use FIT4Green in a supercomputing grid?</h2>
		
		<p>FIT4Green provides a generic communication module for enabling the communication between 
		FIT4Green and the Resource Management System (RMS) which is used on a dedicated supercomputer.  
		This communication module has to be adapted to the needs of the present RMS. There are different 
		ways to adapt the communication module to the FIT4Green plug-in:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Use the already implemented communication module for Torque/PBS based RMS 
			<li>Modify the existent Torque/PBS communication module to the needs of a different RMS
			<li>Implement a new communication module for a dedicated RMS
		</ul>
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>

		<h2><a name="Q2"></a>How to use the communication module with a Torque/PBS based cluster 
		management tool?</h2>
		
		<p>There is already a communication module provided in the FIT4Green software stack which is 
		preconfigured to use the common used Torque/PBS resource manager. This communication module has 
		been tested with the Torque versions &lt;= 2.5.9.
		
		<p>It is necessary to edit the properties file of that Torque communication module. The name of the 
		properties file is predetermined by the name of the module. For example if the module name in the 
		central <font face="Courier New">f4gconfig.properties</font> file is <i>COMDatacentreXYZ_ClusterA</i>, 
		the name of the properties file must be <font face="Courier New">COMDatacentreXYZ_ClusterA.properties</font>. 
		This file must be placed in the Tomcat installation folder of the FIT4Green instance:
		
		<p><font face="Courier New"><i>FIT4Green_TOMCAT_INSTALLATION</i>/common/classes/resources/COMDatacentreXYZ_ClusterA.properties</font>
		
		<p>The README file in the project folder of the supercomputing communication module provides the 
		meaning of the particular properties. The most important properties are the definitions of the used 
		actions to save energy or to start jobs in the cluster environment.

		<h2><a name="Q3"></a>How to use the communication module with a different RMS than Torque?</h2>

		<P>The provided supercomputing communication module was designed to use the Torque RMS. However, the 
		implementation reflects typical tasks which have to be performed in the same way by different RMS. 
		So, the main class <font face="Courier New">org.f4g.com.pbs.ComPBS</font> can be likely used and 
		modified only slightly. The classes which send requests to the Torque RMS and parse the output can be
		found in package <font face="Courier New">org.f4g.com.pbs.common</font>. These classes have to be 
		adapted to the requirements of the used RMS for	getting <i>Node</i> and <i>Job</i> information, 
		sending actions to the system, and reading failure messages.
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>

		<h2><a name="Q4"></a>What are the communication channels between FIT4Green and the cluster?</h2>

		<p>TThe simplest way is to place the FIT4Green server containing the supercomputing communication 
		module directly on the login node of the cluster machine, so that updates and actions can be directly 
		gathered and started on the cluster. In such a scenario FIT4Green must run as the root user, 
		since RMS updates are gathered by requesting the PBS DIS interface.
		
		<p>It might be the case that administrators do not want to install FIT4Green on the cluster. For that 
		purpose a so called <i>proxy</i> application is provided which can be installed on the login node of 
		the	cluster. The communication module connects to the proxy by using secure Java Socket connections 
		and the proxy executes updates and actions on behalf of the communication module. For enabling such a 
		connection it is needed to:
		
		<ul>
			<li>install the proxy on the cluster’s login node (see README file)
			<li>specify an open port for the proxy Java Socket Server in the communication module properties 
			file
			<li>provide client and server keys for the secure connection (sample test keys are provided)
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="Q5"></a>Is it possible to use FIT4Green Torque communication module without any root 
		access?</h2>

		<p>Yes. The University of Mannheim implemented a solution where RMS updates can be requested without 
		root access. Please check the README of the proxy project for that purpose.
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>
		
		<h2><a name="Q6"></a>How to start the proxy application on the cluster?</h2>

		<p>The proxy can simply be started by executing the <font face="Courier New">start_proxy.sh</font> 
		script in the installation directory. After starting, the Socket server waits for client requests 
		from the communication module.
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>
		
		<h2><a name="Q7">How to execute the Torque/PBS RMS actions?</a></h2>

		<p>It is necessary to provide some shell scripts on the cluster side which can be used by 
		FIT4Green and the communication module to execute node, job, and energy saving based actions on the 
		cluster. For that purpose some scripts are already provided which were specified for the test-bed 
		environment	but can also be used as a basis for customized scripts. These scripts can be found in 
		the <i>conf</i> folder of the FZJProxy project. The following scripts were used and can be adapted 
		appropriately:
		
		<ul>
			<li>sleep script for setting a worker node in an energy saving ACPI standby mode
			<li>wake-up script for getting the worker node back to active mode
			<li>an optional power script for reading the current measured power consumption of worker nodes
		</ul>
		
		<p><a href="#top">top</a>
		
		<p>
		
		<h2><a name="Q8">How to start the supercomputing communication module?</a></h2>

		<p>Before the communication module can be used ensure that the following configuration has been done:
		
		<ul>
			<li>The communication module has been deployed as a jar file to the FIT4Green Tomcat’s 
			<font face="Courier New">common/lib</font> folder
			<li>The properties file of the communication module has been configured for the dedicated 
			environment
			<li>If needed, the proxy connection must be in place and configured
			<li>The FIT4Green XML initial model instance of the used environment has been created
			<li>Configure the plug-in by editing the <font face="Courier New">f4gconfig.properties</font> 
			file. The only useful operation mode for the supercomputing environment is fully automatic
			<li>Start the FIT4Green service
		
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="Q9">What is needed when FIT4Green allocation request should be used in federated 
		supercomputing environments for saving energy?</a></h2>

		<p>FIT4Green can be used coupled with the Grid middleware Unicore when jobs should be brokered 
		energy efficiently in federated supercomputing environments. In such a scenario, users submit their 
		jobs by using Unicore to a distributed cluster environment against the background that those jobs 
		should be submitted to the most energy efficient machine. Such an installation needs some 
		configuration work to allow Unicore to send job allocation requests to FIT4Green for getting back 
		the best suitable cluster resource. Please refer to the README file in the supercomputing 
		communication module project for a detailed description of such a configuration.
