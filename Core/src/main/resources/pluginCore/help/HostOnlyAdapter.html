		<h1>How do I configure the network of the host machine?</h1>
		
		<h2>Using Host-Only Adapter</h2>
		
		<p>The following configuration was performed on an OpenSuse 11.2 host system 
		and VirtualBox version 4.0.12.</p>
		
		<p>To enable ssh access from the host to the VM:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Enable the host-only network method in the Virtualbox network 
			settings of your created VM. Please note that the VM must be powered off 
			to make changes in the settings. 
			
			<li>Start the VM. Virtualbox should have set all required 
			networking parameters. So, if you start an ssh daemon on the VM, 
			your guest machine should be available from the host by:
			<pre># ssh fit4green@192.168.56.3</pre>
			
			<li>If this is not working check the routes in your VM with	the route 
			command. Add the Virtualbox gateway if it is not there by running:
			<pre># sudo route add default gw 192.168.56.1</pre>
			and restart the networking.
		</ul>

		<p>To enable the port forwarding rules:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Allow IP forwarding by setting the parameter net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding 
			with sysctl to 1:
			<pre>#  sysctl -A| grep forward
net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding = 1</pre>
			
			<li>Set pre- and postrouting rules in iptables so that you allow in this 
			example configuration access to the VM tomcat port 8080 from everywhere 
			outside and from the VM. Refer to your iptables version for setting the 
			right commands and parameters. In the end it should look like the 
			following:
			<pre># iptables -t nat -L -v
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 2400 packets, 216K bytes)
pkts  bytes  target      prot  opt   in   out    source    destination
   3    144    DNAT       tcp   --  any   any  anywhere        zam1073      tcp dpt:http-alt to:192.168.56.3:8080

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 29 packets, 2696 bytes)
pkts  bytes  target      prot  opt   in   out    source    destination
1959   131K  MASQUERADE   all   --  any  eth0  anywhere     anywhere

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 52 packets, 4516 bytes)
pkts  bytes  target      prot  opt   in   out    source    destination</pre>
			
			<li>You should save the rules so that they are set on reboot 
			automatically.
			
			<li>Test the connection by starting a proxy daemon on a dedicated target 
			system and  also start the tomcat server on the VM. 
		</ul>
