		<h1>How do I configure the network of the host machine?</h1>
		
		<h2>VirtualBox networking recommendations</h2>
		
		<p>A typical use case for the FIT4Green live CD is to run it on a dedicated 
		host having the same network access to and from the outer world on the VM as 
		on the host machine. When using the default VirtualBox networking 
		<b>Network Address Translation (NAT)</b>, the VM with the live CD will be 
		invisible and unreachable from the outside world. So, you do not have access 
		to the FIT4Green Tomcat server. Also ssh from the host to the VM is not 
		available.</p>
		
		<p>To solve these issues, you can follow one of the methods below:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Use the VirtualBox network method <b>Bridged Adapter</b>. This allows 
			to run a VM which will be assigned an IP address automatically from the 
			DCHP server in your network; it will behave as a separate machine 
			and you can access it from ssh, http, etc.. (provided that the 
			configuration rules of your network allow it) in the same way you would 
			do with any other physical machine connected to your network. 
			For details see <a href="../help/BridgedAdapter.html">here</a>.</li>
		
			<li>Use the VirtualBox network method <b>Host-only Adapter</b>. In this case
			you have to also enable some port forwarding rules, so that the VM can be 
			connected from outside (e.g. the proxy software on the target systems can 
			communicate with communication plug-ins in the Tomcat server).
